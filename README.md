### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Kyle Bastien, I'm a Software Engineer working at Microsoft, and doing my best to contribute to open source whenever/wherever I can. I work mostly on TypeScript/JavaScript based projects, but consider myself a full stack engineer with knowledge of C# and Java. My interests are in things like monorepos, accessibility, web application performance, micro frontends, and code sharing. You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1], or on [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2].

### ‚å®Ô∏è Some stuff I work on

- I open sourced [nx-azure](https://github.com/microsoft/nx-azure), which is set of tools to make working with Nx monorepos easier with Azure resources.
- I contribute to [Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx), which is set of extensible dev tools for monorepos, and the best monorepo tools in the world in my opinion.
- I work on a variety of different services in the Teams family, but also across Microsoft 365.

### üìàGithub Stats

Why TypeScript doesn't surface here I'm not sure.
